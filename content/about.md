# Hello there!

My name is JosÃ© Diogo Viana, but everyone calls me **/(ZÃ©|Diogo)/**.

I'm based in Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ and at the moment I work at **[Remote](https://remote.com)**, as an Elixir Senior Backend Engineer, helping to make it easy for companies to hire, pay, and manage their teams globally.

At night, I'm building **[Albwer](https://www.albwer.com)**, with a great friend.

Always looking forward to learn new and cool things, either work related or just general knowledge.

On another note, in my free time, I'm a football goalkeeper coach since 2016. 

I'm also a ***wannabe handyman*** that likes to tinker with mostly unuseful stuff around the house/garden, and sometimes they don't turn out that well... (\*\*Insert *"Some times may be good, sometimes may be sh\*t"* meme.\*\*). I've always liked mechanical and analogue objects, and at the moment I own a couple of cool things like a Typewriter from the ~50s, a Turntable from around the ~70s, and even my day-to-day watch that doesn't have any batteries (and no, it's not a state of the art solar powered smartwatch ðŸ˜…). I still have the passion and the wonder for the digital world, otherwise, I wouldn't be here writing and working as a Software Engineer (and I like to do it), but keeping the balance between *analogue* and *digital* is very important to me.

Look around the website to discover more things in detail.
