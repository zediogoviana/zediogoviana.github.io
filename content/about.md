# Hello there!

My name is JosÃ© Diogo Viana, but everyone calls me **/(ZÃ©|Diogo)/**.

I'm based in Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ and at the moment I work at **[finiam](https://finiam.com)**, helping with the mission to change the financial world, by working with other businesses to launch their products to market.

I work as a Fullstack Developer, but the Backend is where I spend most of my day, using Elixir + Phoenix or Ruby on Rails. I am always looking forward to learn new and cool things, either work related or just general knowledge.

My language of preference is Elixir and I've been using it since 2019.

Look around the website to discover more things in detail.
