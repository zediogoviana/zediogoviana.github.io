I've always been very pro-active and wanting to try out new things. So, in this page you can check some of my **Personal** projects, together with others I help develop and maintain at **[finiam](https://finiam.com)**, outside our usual client work.

Most of these are available on my **[GitHub page](https://github.com/zediogoviana)**, but I'll describe them shortly here also.

## Personal Projects

- **[ThePipeTracker](https://www.tipoprado.thepipetracker.com)** \
A Production line tracking for SMEs. It's a Web Application for clients of an SME to track orders/packages inside a production pipeline. Together with production analysis plots and a dedicated module for delivery date prediction using Discrete Events Simulation theory (I wrote a blog post about this [here](https://zediogoviana.github.io/posts/simulations-with-elixir-and-the-actor-model/)). \
API built with Elixir and Frontend built with React. Running in production for 3+ years and still helping the company with production efficiency. \
**[Jul 2019 - Present]** 

&nbsp;
- **[Ethcule Poirot](https://github.com/zediogoviana/ethcule-poirot)** \
Elixir app to explore Ethereum transactions using a Neo4J database to store addresses and respective relationships, in a Graph structure. Its goal is to work as a tooling service, by plug-and-playing different APIs with it. \
I was invited to talk about this project in a **Neo4j Live** (a live stream hosted by Neo4j in their socials). You can check the video below:

- **Software Testing Workshop (Elixir)** \
A workshop with [Jos√© Resende](https://zepedroresende.github.io/) also from **[finiam](https://finiam.com)**. This workshop was for participants in the *CeSIUM Summer Camp*. (Video in portuguese only.)

- **[Keyboard Heatmap](https://github.com/zediogoviana/keyboard-heatmap)**\
Simple Elixir script to obtain an heatmap of your keystrokes. Keystrokes can be collected for the amount of time you choose.


## Finiam's Open Source Projects

- **[Secrets](https://github.com/finiam/secrets.finiam.com)**\
A simple web app that transmits E2E encrypted messages safely. 

&nbsp;
- **[Detris](https://github.com/finiam/ethamsterdam-detris)**\
An hackathon project we did for [ETHAmsterdam](https://amsterdam.ethglobal.com/) in April 2022. Detris, is a playable NFT that serves as an interface to play Tetris. What does that mean? It means that the NFT can run an instance of a game of Tetris. The asset the Detris NFT is retrieving is actually our implementation of the game of Tetris. We use an `iframe` to display it wherever we want. And since OpenSea supports iframe too, we can actually [play Tetris on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xbdc105c068715d57860702da9fa0c5ead11fba51/2). With this project we were one of the 13 finalists and winners of the hackathon. We ended up winning a monetary prize per team member, and got the chance to present it on stage, in front of hundreds of others participants! It was a really cool experience.
