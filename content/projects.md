I've always been very pro-active and wanting to try out new things. So, in this page you can check some of my **Personal** projects, together with others I help develop and maintain at **[finiam](https://finiam.com)**, outside our usual client work.

Most of these are available on my **[GitHub page](https://github.com/zediogoviana)**, but I'll describe them shortly here also.

## Personal Projects

- **[ThePipeTracker](https://www.tipoprado.thepipetracker.com)** \
A Production line tracking for SMEs. It's a Web Application for clients of an SME to track orders/packages inside a production pipeline. Together with production analysis plots and a dedicated module for delivery date prediction using Discrete Events Simulation theory (I wrote a blog post about this [here]). \
API built with Elixir and Frontend built with React. Running in production for 3+ years and still helping the company with production efficiency. \
**[Jul 2019 - Present]**

- **[Ethcule Poirot](https://github.com/zediogoviana/ethcule-poirot)** \
Elixir app to explore Ethereum transactions using a Neo4J database to store addresses and respective relationships, in a Graph structure. Its goal is to work as a tooling service, by plug-and-playing different APIs with it. \
I was invited to talk about this project in a **Neo4j Live** (a live stream hosted by Neo4j in their socials). You can check the video below:

- **Software Testing Workshop (Elixir)** \
A workshop with [Jos√© Resende](https://zepedroresende.github.io/) also from **[finiam](https://finiam.com)**. This workshop was for participants in the *CeSIUM Summer Camp*. (Video in portuguese only.)

- **[Keyboard Heatmap](https://github.com/zediogoviana/keyboard-heatmap)**\
Simple Elixir script to obtain an heatmap of your keystrokes. Keystrokes can be collected for the amount of time you choose.


## Finiam's Open Source Projects

- **[Secrets](https://github.com/finiam/secrets.finiam.com)**\
A simple web app that transmits E2E encrypted messages safely. 

&nbsp;
- **[Detris](https://github.com/finiam/ethamsterdam-detris)**\
An hackathon project we did for [ETHAmsterdam](https://amsterdam.ethglobal.com/) in April 2022. It's an Tetris NFT that you can play on IPFS or platforms like OpenSea. With this project we were one of the 13 finalists and winners of the hackathon.
