There's a chance that you have heard of [*Metamask*](https://metamask.io/) in the past year or two. But, if you haven't, don't worry, as I'll try to explain it quickly. *Metamask* is an [*Ethereum*](https://ethereum.org/en/) crypto wallet, and serves as a gateway to *dApps* (decentralized Apps). *Coinbase* has the following definition for a crypto wallet:

> Crypto wallets store your private keys, keeping your crypto safe and accessible. They also allow you to send, receive, and spend cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

For a more complete explanation, I recommend reading [their full blog post](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-crypto-wallet), but for the ones that won't read it, I want to highlight that *Metamask* is just one option between several existing **Hot Wallets (Online Wallets)**. However, for various reasons that don't matter here, *Metamask* grew into one of the most used wallets. 

The main idea of my discussion today is not limited to the *Metamask* wallet only but can be applied to any other wallet as well. However, you'd need to adjust the code a bit for other wallets, as they may handle *Javascript* events differently. If you want to support multiple wallets in your *dApp* instead of doing all the manual work for each one individually, it's probably best to look into things like [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/), [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/), etc.

My teammate [David Lange](https://github.com/davelange) did an awesome talk for [Coimbra.Blockchain](https://twitter.com/coimblockchain?lang=en) where he talks about some of the hurdles and tools to use when developing a frontend for a *dApp*. I definitely recommend watching [the presentation video](https://www.youtube.com/live/qqlRjpXY_Pc?feature=share&t=256). (It takes about 40 minutes.)

## Why is it relevant?

By using a solution such as `Sign in with Metamask` (or any other wallet, as highlighted before) the user doesn't need to worry about an extra `username + password` combo for our App. Yes, I know that there are password managers, and it makes these worries a bit redundant, but let's be honest... End users of these apps don't want to trust us with their emails and passwords, even if they are random. Also, they already need to have a wallet to interact with other Blockchain features, so we might as well take advantage of that.

This can be used as a reliable authentication method because we know that only the person with access to that wallet's private key will be able to cryptographically sign a message, that when verified it'll correspond to the public key. **Side note: in Ethereum, and some other blockchains, the public key corresponds to the *Wallet's Address*.** We'll see below how this works with a bit more detail.

## How does it work?

If you are still here, then I'm going to assume that you're familiar with how **Asymmetric Encryption** works (read [this post](https://www.babypips.com/crypto/learn/what-is-asymmetric-encryption) if not).

The image below tries to represent how a crypto wallet can be used as a valid sign-in mechanism. The application's backend gives the User a message to sign with the wallet's private key. The backend then receives the encrypted message and uses the Wallet's Public Key (its Address, for Ethereum) to decrypt it and verify it against the original one.

{{< image src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/5aprln8a/production/6896ce3bd0deef7a875a6fc54d8457a5d9b120ba-716x361.png" alt="sign in with crypto wallet mechanism" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Some of the more trained eyes may have seen a possible issue with the scheme above. Bear with me for a little more, because I'm going to address it in some paragraphs below.

An **important note** for this blog post is that the flow I'm talking about is for situations where we have a dedicated backend, and we want to maintain some kind of session between our App and the User. It's very frequent to have *dApps* that don't need a dedicated backend, so the User just connects its Wallet to the frontend, and can then interact directly with Smart Contracts running in the blockchain.

In the same way, `Metamask` gives you an interface to make transactions in the blockchain, it also allows the User to just sign simple text messages, using their private keys. The following image is one example. This action is completely off-chain, so therefore it doesn't have associated costs or delays.

## Why Elixir and Liveview?

Well, why not? That's a valid reason, but I like to think that I have a more elaborate answer for this. To start, most projects in the Web3/Crypto space have separate frontends from the backend (at least the ones that have a dedicated backend). The reason for this is mainly because there are a lot of tools that can help with quick development if using any modern Javascript Framework. 

In my case, I just wanted to do a simple **API Playground** where any user could interact with the [project I was working on](https://dora-the-tipset-explorer.fly.dev/), but where it'd be possible to have an authenticated place. The API was all built with *Elixir*, and *Phoenix 1.7* was a couple of days from being released, so I decided to take the opportunity and do something using *LiveView*, and have a learning experience.

## A look into the desired Flow

I can't say I have used many crypto Wallets, but most of them work pretty much the same way. Before interacting with a *dApp*, you first need to connect the wallet to that website. I'll explain better what this is, down the line, but it's a required step regardless if you want the app to trigger any action from the wallet.

Focusing only on our goal of implementing a **Sign In with Metamask** flow, the base flow should look like this:

1. Connect the wallet;
2. Sign a message;
3. Validate the signature on the backend;
4. Create a Session token, if the signature is valid.

Above, we have already seen how we can sign messages using *Metamask*, but there is a problem with the flow I described... In that example, the user signs a message saying `Here is a message!`, and then the backend validates the signature, checking if it matches the original message. Even if you don't know much about cryptography, you can understand that if you always sign the same message contents, the resulting signature is the same, also. So, if your key is `A` and you are signing `B`, the final signature is always `C`. This way, if an attacker can intercept the Signature going from *Metamask* to the backend, then it'd be able to impersonate the actual wallet owner and sign in with our Application because the signature would be valid!

To solve that problem, we need to have a `Nonce` associated with each User in the database. With it, we make sure that every time a user is signing a message to log in to our app, that message has an extra number/string to make it different every time, therefore resulting in different signatures. Then, as our backend knows the base message, and the `nonce` given to the respective user trying to sign in, it's still possible to fully validate if the signature is valid or not.

All good up until now? It's time to dive into some code and see how all of this glues together.

## Getting our hands dirty

The first step I took was to look for existing examples using *Elixir* and *LiveView*. I end up finding [this interesting presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzB0-8syuTU), by Crystal Adkins, talking about what I wanted to learn about! The presentation links to the respective [Github Repo](https://github.com/revelrylabs/liveview_web3/tree/presentation) of the project demonstrated during it. After exploring for a bit, I was able to understand how the interactions between *LiveView* and *Metamask* worked through JS, so I started working on my own version of the code.

**Note:** There are some differences between the project presented by Crystal Adkins and our use case. For example, you first had to sign in/up using email and password, and only then you could associate and connect *Metamask* with your account. In that codebase, you always sign the same message (the problem I mentioned), but I assume that it was just a Proof of Concept of the capabilities of *LiveView*. The same project also did more complex stuff like actually interacting with Smart Contracts, something that I'm not talking about today, and it wouldn't be present in our situation.

**Second Note:** The message structure being signed in my version, doesn't follow any [Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)](https://eips.ethereum.org/) like [EIP-4361](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361). EIPs describe standards for the Ethereum platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards. To implement something like that, you'd just need to change the message contents and add more information for User signing it.

To manage sessions and all the corresponding logic, I decided to use the `mix phx.gen.auth Accounts User users` generator, and remove all of the unwanted parts (like account confirmation, reset password flows, etc...). It's a pretty standard approach and works just fine.

Then I started the actual implementation of the **Sign In** button. This button is a *LiveView* component, and has the following `mount` function:

```elixir
defmodule DoraWeb.MetamaskButtonLive do
  use DoraWeb, :live_view
  
  @impl true
  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    {:ok,
     assign(socket,
       connected: false,
       current_wallet_address: nil,
       signature: nil,
       verify_signature: false
     )}
  end
  
  # render logic and event handlers...
end
```

Looking at the `assigns` and explaining what each of them represents, is very simple:

 - `connected`: if the *Metamask* Wallet is already connected to our website or not. (The connect thing, I mentioned before). We can get this information from `window.ethereum`, and I'll explain what it is, next.
 - `current_wallet_address`: if the Wallet is already connected, or the User just connected, we can retrieve which Address it corresponds to. (Don't forget that here the Address is also the Public Key.)
 - `signature`: after triggering a signing request, this `assign` will hold the signature to be sent to the backend, for verification.
 - `verify-signature`: is supposed to work as a flag to trigger the verification process or not.

The render function is also understandable at first look. If we have `@connected` as true, then we can render the `Sign In` message, trigger a new Signature Request, and then the respective verification. If `@connected` is false, then we render `Connect`, and clicking on the button triggers the Wallet connection, instead.

```elixir
@impl true
def render(assigns) do
  ~H"""
  <span title="Metamask" id="metamask-button" phx-hook="Metamask">
    <%= if @connected do %>
      <.form
        for={%{}}
        action={~p"/users/log_in"}
        as={:user}
        phx-submit="verify-current-wallet"
        phx-trigger-action={@verify_signature}
      >
        <.input type="hidden" name="public_address" value={@current_wallet_address} />
        <.input type="hidden" name="signature" value={@signature} />
        <.button class={button_css()}>
          <span class="w-6"><.metamask_icon /></span> Sign in
        </.button>
      </.form>
    <% else %>
      <.button class={button_css()} phx-click="connect-metamask">
        <span class="w-6"><.metamask_icon /></span> Connect
      </.button>
    <% end %>
  </span>
  """
end
```

Let's start by inspecting `phx-click="connect-metamask"` for the case where the Wallet is not connected. It relies on the `push_event` function. It's a small function, but very powerful in that way that enables us to easily communicate with the Javascript side of the App, by [pushing an event to the client](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html#push_event/3), and where we can interact directly with *Metamask*.

```elixir
@impl true
def handle_event("connect-metamask", _params, socket) do
  {:noreply, push_event(socket, "connect-metamask", %{})}
end
```

### How to interact with *Metamask* from Javascript?

*MetaMask* injects a global API into websites visited by its users at `window.ethereum`. This API allows websites to request users' Ethereum accounts, read data from blockchains the user is connected to, and suggest that the user sign messages and transactions. 

Consequently, to interact with `window.ethereum`, we have Javascript libraries like [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/getting-started/) or [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.8.2/). I end up using `Ethers`, but you can select whatever you see fit. To handle the event above, you need something like:

```javascript
const web3Provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum)

window.addEventListener(`phx:connect-metamask`, (e) => {
    web3Provider.provider.request({method: 'eth_requestAccounts'}).then((accounts) => {
      if (accounts.length > 0) {
        signer.getAddress().then((address) => {
            this.pushEvent("wallet-connected", {public_address: address})
        });
      }
    }, (error) => console.log(error))
})
```

Upon successful connection of the Wallet, a new event `"wallet-connected"` is pushed with the respectively connected address. We can handle this event in our *LiveView* file, just like any other emitted by our template. When receiving that event, we set `@connected` to its new state, and we also update `@current_wallet_address`. By changing these two `assigns` the button will now render a different thing entirely because the Wallet is already connected to our app.

```elixir
@impl true
def handle_event("wallet-connected", params, socket) do
  {:noreply,
   assign(socket,
     connected: not is_nil(params["public_address"]),
     current_wallet_address: params["public_address"]
   )}
end
```

Since we are already connected, when clicking our new button, the event emitted when trying to submit the form is `phx-submit="verify-current-wallet"`. Even though this form is a post to `~p"/users/log_in"`, this action will only be triggered when `@verify_signature` is true, due to `phx-trigger-action={@verify_signature}` (check the [`px-trigger-action` docs](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/form-bindings.html#submitting-the-form-action-over-http) for more info on how it works).

The handler for this event looks for an existing account to return its current `nonce`, or if an account for that Address doesn't exist, then it generates a new `nonce` in the spot. This way, we don't distinguish if a User trying to sign a message to log in will have a valid account or not (the process will fail later instead). This `nonce` is then pushed to the Javascript client side and will be used for the signing process.

```elixir
@impl true
def handle_event("verify-current-wallet", _params, socket) do
  nonce =
    case Accounts.get_user_by_eth_address(socket.assigns.current_wallet_address) do
      nil -> Accounts.generate_account_nonce()
      user -> user.nonce
    end
  
  {:noreply, push_event(socket, "get-current-wallet", %{nonce: nonce})}
end
```

The Javascript code is actually very similar, and through `signer.signMessage(message)` a window, similar to the image shown in the introduction part, will appear and the User will be able to sign that message. If the user ends up signing the message, we can push a new event with the result in the payload, and listen to it on the *LiveView* component side.

As a separate note, there are several events triggered by *Metamask* (and not our app) that you can also listen to, and make everything feel even snappier. I didn't dive into details, but [here](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/ethereum-provider.html#table-of-contents) you can find docs for API description and the full list of events.

```javascript
window.addEventListener(`phx:get-current-wallet`, (e) => {
    signer.getAddress().then((address) => {
        const message = `You are signing this message to sign in with Dora. Nonce: ${e.detail.nonce}`

        signer.signMessage(message).then((signature) => {
            this.pushEvent("verify-signature", {public_address: address, signature: signature})

            return;
        })
    })
})
```

Then, the event pushed by *Javascript* is handled again on the *LiveView* Component, and `@verify_signature` is marked as `true`. This way, the form submission is triggered at this time, and the post to `~p"/users/log_in"` is done.

```elixir
@impl true
def handle_event("verify-signature", params, socket) do
  {:noreply,
   assign(socket,
     signature: params["signature"],
     verify_signature: true
   )}
end
```

On the Session controller's side, we receive the form params (`public_address` and `signature`), and we verify the signature. If it's valid we call `UserAuth.log_in_user(user, params)`, if it's not, we redirect back to `~p"/"`.

To verify the User's signature, [`ExWeb3EcRecover`](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_web3_ec_recover/0.1.0/ExWeb3EcRecover.html) is being used. This is a "simple" library that exports one function `recover_personal_signature/2`. This function returns the address that created the signature for a personally signed message by an Ethereum Wallet. So, in our case, we can reconstruct the original messages by the User (we have its `nonce` stored in the DB still), and then we check if the Address trying to sign in with that signature is the same that signed the message in the first place. If so, we update the `nonce` to a new random value, and we return the `user` model as success.

```elixir
def verify_message_signature(eth_address, signature) do
  with user = %User{} <- find_user_by_public_address(eth_address) do
    message = "You are signing this message to sign in with Dora. Nonce: #{user.nonce}"
  
    signing_address = ExWeb3EcRecover.recover_personal_signature(message, signature)
  
    if String.downcase(signing_address) == String.downcase(eth_address) do
      update_user_nonce(eth_address)
      user
    end
  end
end
```

`ExWeb3EcRecover` depends on [`ex_keccak`](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_keccak/ExKeccak.html), which means you'll need to have *Rust* installed to compile it. For a quick and easy *Rust* install follow [these instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

As you probably have noticed, in our flow no new accounts are created. That's because, for this project, only pre-configured wallets should be able to sign in. However, the change needed to have that working as a `sign up` should be pretty simple. For example, in the code snippet for the wallet connected, we can do something like this:

```elixir
@impl true
def handle_event("wallet-connected", params, socket) do
  address = params["public_address"]
  # also validate if is not nil! The User may not connect the wallet
  Accounts.create_user_if_not_exists(address) 

  {:noreply,
   assign(socket,
     connected: not is_nil(address),
     current_wallet_address: address
   )}
end
```
