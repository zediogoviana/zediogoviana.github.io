<h1>Beer Bottles Map</h1>

<p>
  What does this <b>Beer Bottle</b> Map mean? Well, I collect Beer Bottles from different countries, and I can only add them to the collection if they were bought in the country of origin. So to keep track of all the locations, I have a map in <a href="https://felt.com">Felt</a> (beer locations are represented in <span style="color: red">red</span>). Some of them were brought in by friends and family, so a <b>cheers üç∫</b> to all of those who have contributed!

<h1>Visited Countries Map</h1>

<p>The smaller <span style="color:#23B0FF">blue</span> highlights represent the locations I have visited personally. On a quick note, I don't have beer bottles from all places I've been to, as I only started collecting them around 2017.
