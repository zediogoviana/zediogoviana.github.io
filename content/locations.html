<h1>Beer Bottles Map</h1>

<p>
  What does this <b>Beer Bottle</b> Map mean? Well, I collect Beer Bottles from different countries, and I can only add them to the collection if they were bought in the country of origin. So to keep track of all the locations, I have a map using <a href="https://felt.com">Felt</a>. Some of them were brought in by friends and family, so a <b>cheers üç∫</b> to all of those who have contributed!
